                <p>Suzume (Japanese: すずめの戸締まり, Hepburn: Suzume no Tojimari, lit. "Suzume's Locking Up") is a 2022 Japanese animated fantasy adventure film written and directed by Makoto Shinkai, produced by CoMix Wave Films, and distributed by Toho. The film features the voices of Nanoka Hara and Hokuto Matsumura, with the character designs by Masayoshi Tanaka, animation direction by Kenichi Tsuchiya, art direction by Takumi Tanji, and music by Radwimps and Kazuma Jinnouchi. Suzume is Shinkai's third collaboration with Radwimps and Tanaka, after Your Name (2016) and Weathering with You (2019), and was inspired by the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. The film follows 17-year-old high school student Suzume Iwato and Souta Munakata, who team up to prevent a series of disasters across Japan.

                    The film began its production in early 2020, eventually being announced as completed by October 2022. A novel adaptation, also written by Shinkai, and a manga series illustrated by Denki Amashima both debuted prior to the film's release.
                    
                    Suzume first premiered in IMAX in Japan on November 7, 2022, and was theatrically released nationwide on November 11; it was released internationally across 2023 by Crunchyroll, Sony Pictures Releasing (under the Sony Pictures Releasing International banner), and Wild Bunch International. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for its animation, characters, emotional weight and music, although some reviewers criticized the plot for being structurally similar to Shinkai's previous films. It has grossed over $300.6 million worldwide, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2022 in Japan and the fourth-highest-grossing Japanese film of all time.

                    Suzume Iwato is a 17-year-old high school girl who lives with her aunt in Kyushu. One night, she dreams of searching for her mother as a child in a ruined neighborhood. The next morning, while headed for school, Suzume encounters a young man searching for abandoned areas with doors. She tells him about an old onsen resort nearby, then follows the man herself to the resort. Suzume finds a door standing alone on its frame, which shows a starlit field through the doorway, but she is unable to enter it. She picks up a cat statue which becomes a real cat and flees. Frightened, she heads back to school. During lunchtime, Suzume notices a blaze-like column arising from the site of the onsen that nobody else can see. Returning there, she finds the man from before, trying to close the door. Seeing him struggle and get injured, Suzume rushes to help. They successfully close the door and the red column disappears, but not before crashing invisibly into the town and causing earthquake-like damage.
                    
                    Suzume takes the man, Souta Munakata, to her home to bandage his wound. He explains that he travels across Japan, finding and locking doors in abandoned places to prevent a giant supernatural "worm" from causing earthquakes. The cat from the resort appears and turns Souta into the child's chair he was sitting on. Souta, now a three-legged chair, chases the cat to a ferry headed for Ehime with Suzume following. He describes the cat as a keystone, and that the worm was released after its removal from near the abandoned door.
                    
                    At Ehime, the pair use clues on social media from locals who have photographed the cat and named it "Daijin" to follow it across Shikoku. With the help of local resident Chika, they find the worm and close its door of entry at an abandoned school. They stay at Chika's home after the fiasco and Suzume finds out that the school used to be where Chika attended middle school. When they leave trying to find someone who can take them to Kobe, the location of next door, a mother named Rumi picks them up since she's from there. When they arrive at the city Rumi asks Suzume to babysit her twin toddlers and help serve customers at her bar afterward. At the bar Suzume finds Daijin sitting with the patrons waiting for them to notice him and the worm reemerging. Suzume and Sōta chase after Daijin to an old abandoned amusement park where the worm is located. Sōta demands that Daijin turn back into a keystone, but he refuses, wanting to "play" with Suzume. Suzume tasked to close the door is enchanted by seeing the starlit field again but this time with her childhood self and an unknown female figure in the distance. Sōta has to abandon fighting the cat in order to save Suzume from falling and to make sure the portal is closed. After locking the door Sōta explains the portal leads to the Ever-After where souls go after death. As they spend the night at Rumi's bar, it is revealed that Sōta is losing his sense of self in his chair form.
                    
                    After tracking Daijin to Tokyo, Sōta has Suzume take him to his apartment. He explains the myth of the worm Namazu, and how it is pacified by the placement of two keystones in eastern and western Japan. The western keystone has become the cat Daijin, while records of the eastern keystone's location are obscure. Should the worm appear in Tokyo, it could destroy the city similar to the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake. Daijin reappears and reveals that he had passed on his function as a keystone to Sōta's chair form. After finding the reemerged worm, Sōta turns into a keystone in Suzume's hands, leaving Suzume to seal it away. She does so and wakes up in a water cave housing Tokyo's doorway. Peering into the Ever-After, she sees the keystone Sōta but again cannot enter to reach him. Daijin approaches Suzume excitedly, telling her that he can be her cat now. Instead, Suzume furiously grabs Daijin and nearly throws him, before dropping him into the water and telling him to never speak to her again. Heartbroken, Daijin walks away.
                    
                    Suzume visits Sōta's grandfather at the hospital. He explains that Suzume's ability to see the worm and the Ever-After through the doors means that she has accidentally entered the realm once before. Moreover, the doorway that she first used is the only place where she can reenter the Ever-After and save Sōta.
                    
                    Reuniting with her Aunt Tamaki, who followed her from Kyushu, Suzume travels to her childhood hometown in Tōhoku, which was destroyed in the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami together with the help from Sōta's fellow university classmate and friend, Tomoya Serizawa whom she met at Sōta's apartment right before the worm appeared in Tokyo. At a rest stop along the way, Suzume discovers that Tamaki was possessed by Sadaijin, the eastern keystone. Tamaki takes Suzume to the ruins of her old house where she once lived with her mother/Tamaki's sister, a nurse who was killed in the tsunami. Suzume finds her old door and enters with Daijin and Sadaijin. She emerges in the Ever-After, which appears as her town following the earthquake-tsunami. While Sadaijin distracts the worm, Suzume awakens Sōta, returning him to human form. Admitting defeat, Daijin returns to being a keystone. With Daijin and Sadaijin, Suzume and Sōta reseal the worm, preventing it from leaving the Ever-After.
                    
                    Sōta then notices a child in the Ever-After: Suzume from 12 years ago. Suzume remembers how she entered the Ever-After as a child following her mother's death. She takes her childhood chair from the Ever-After version of her home and gives it to her younger self, telling her about her future. Young Suzume exits the Ever-After with the chair, leading to her being found by Tamaki 12 years prior. Suzume and Sōta leave the Ever-After themselves, with Sōta returning to Tokyo while Suzume and Tamaki return to Kyushu, revisiting the friends she made along the way.
                    
                    Sometime later, back in Miyazaki, Suzume is on her way to school when she once again runs into Sōta, walking up the same road where they first met</p>

                <p id="dev">Development

                    The 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami served as an influence for the film. The stranded catamaran Hamayuri [ja] in this aerial image taken in Ōtsuchi, Iwate became the prototype of the stranded vessel appearing in the afterlife scene.
                    Makoto Shinkai conceived the idea for Suzume while he was traveling around Japan to give talks about his past works. He said, "In Japan, it is customary to hold a jichin-sai [ja] or groundbreaking ceremony, before construction begins on a new building or home, but we do nothing when we close them down." Shinkai noticed that there were more empty or abandoned areas in Japan due to the country's declining birth rate and aging population, so he thought of writing a story about "mourning deserted places."[11][12] As a result, the film inevitably turned into a road movie about visiting places.[13]
                    
                    The 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami served as an influence for the themes in the film. While the Tiamat comet in Your Name and the concept of Weathering with You were ideas influenced by the natural disaster, Shinkai felt that he should "express the impact [he] felt through the earthquake and tsunami, instead of continuing to depict it as a metaphor."[11][12] He feared that people's memories of the disaster start to become "hazy" over time, and by depicting the earthquake and tsunami in his film or novel, he could also share his memories with teens who were unaware of the disaster.[11] Shinkai also cited Kiki's Delivery Service, Guardian: The Lonely and Great God, and Haruki Murakami's novel Kafka on the Shore and short story "Kaeru-kun, Tokyo o Sukuu" (かえるくん、東京を救う, "Super-Frog Saves Tokyo") as influences for the film.[12][14]
                    
                    Shinkai and his staff planned the project from January to March 2020. They started developing the film's script in April, which is when the Japanese government declared a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[15][16] In an interview with TV Asahi, Shinkai mentioned that the pandemic had a less tangible effect on the film's production. However, he said that "the mood of the times is indelibly etched into the script", adding that the film will have a post-apocalyptic theme.[16] Sōta turning into a chair was in reference to Shinkai feeling trapped during the COVID-19 curbs.[11] After finishing the script in August, the storyboards were drafted from September 2020 to December 2021, while the production of the animation started in April 2021.[15] The film was officially unveiled during a press conference on December 15, 2021. The film's staff includes Masayoshi Tanaka as the character designer, Kenichi Tsuchiya as the animation director, and Takumi Tanji as the art director. CoMix Wave Films and Story Inc. were revealed as the film's producers.[15] In October 2022, Shinkai announced that production on the film was completed.[17]</p>

                <h4 class="heading">Characters</h4>
                <p>Shinkai immediately decided for the film to have a female main character, since Weathering with You had a male main character, and also felt that a "buddy" character was necessary.[12] Initially, he wanted Suzume's companion to be another girl, with a "sisterhood type of romantic story," as he believed that he had exhausted the potential of the "boy meets girl" formula in previous films. However, Shinkai's producer discouraged the idea, saying that the audience for his films was still enjoying the typical romance aspects of his films.[18][19] Thus, making the partner a chair was decided upon both to avoid the film becoming "too much of a romance,"[18] and also to lighten the mood of the film, which would "inevitably become quieter" if the story focused on mourning a place.[12] Shinkai also considered other options for potential partners,[12] such as a partner that turns into a monster throughout the story, and other "inorganic partners" like a milk carton.[12] The idea for a chair partner came when Shinkai saw a wooden chair sitting at a deserted bus stop, and found its "foreign feeling" to be better than any of his previous ideas. Shinkai also became less interested in writing a love story and wanted to depict different relationships, like with Suzume and her aunt.[12]

                    Nanoka Hara (left) and Hokuto Matsumura (right) provided the voices for Suzume and Sōta, respectively.
                    Nanoka Hara was revealed as the voice of Suzume Iwato on July 5, 2022. Shinkai selected her from an audition involving more than 1,700 people. Hara has been a fan of Shinkai's works, remarking that she could not imagine being the one to share the "unforgettable, heart-shaking sensation" she felt when first seeing one of his films in theaters.[4][20] On September 6, 2022, Hokuto Matsumura's role as Sōta Munakata was revealed. He described the character as one that "[he] had never seen in any of the director's works". Therefore, Matsumura gave a voice for Sōta that he "had never heard before," which involved using a slightly lower tone. Shinkai found his voice to be "impressive" and said that it "embodies the character".[21] Suzume and Sōta are Hara and Matsumura's first anime voice-acting roles.[4][21] On September 29, Eri Fukatsu, Shota Sometani, Sairi Ito, Kotone Hanase, Kana Hanazawa, and Matsumoto Hakuō II were revealed to be joining the voice cast.[7] On October 25, Ryūnosuke Kamiki, who voiced Taki Tachibana in Your Name, was added to the cast for the role of Tomoya Serizawa Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
